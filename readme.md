the vaccination form is updated. previously when the data was entered. it duplicate due to the insert statement. i put a check on that using registration id as foreign key in vaccination center table. so if the record is already inserted. it will only be updated and not inserted again.


login form for vaccination center work done.. the user will have a branch code along with the login crendentials and will be prompt to vaccination center form on sucessful login
